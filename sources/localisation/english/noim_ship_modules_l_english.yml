 ship_hull_hybrid_bb_2: "1940 Hybrid Battleship"
 ship_hull_hybrid_bb_2_desc: "By marrying the heavy guns of a battleship with the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, this design promises both long-range striking power and formidable surface combat capability. Though a compromise in both roles, it offers flexibility in an era where adaptability may decide the seas."
 ship_hull_hybrid_bb_3: "1944 Hybrid Battleship"
 ship_hull_hybrid_bb_3_desc: "Building on earlier designs, the advanced hybrid carrier integrates modern fire control, streamlined flight operations, and improved armor layouts. No longer a compromise, these vessels can bring both air wings and heavy guns to bear with lethal efficiency, commanding respect from any foe on the high seas."
 escort_carrier_2: "Basic Escort Carrier"
 escort_carrier_2_desc: "Smaller and easier to produce than fleet carriers, these converted merchant hulls can escort convoys and provide vital air cover against submarines and raiders. Though slower and carrying fewer aircraft, their presence greatly increases the safety of our sea lanes."
 escort_carrier_3: "Improved Escort Carrier"
 escort_carrier_3_desc: "Refined designs with greater speed, endurance, and aircraft capacity now allow escort carriers to serve in frontline operations. Equipped with modern radar and advanced anti-submarine gear, they can protect convoys, support amphibious landings, and extend our reach far across the oceans."
