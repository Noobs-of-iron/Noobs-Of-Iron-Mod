  asymetricalwarfare_desc: "Conventional armies rely on numbers and firepower — but we exploit terrain, mobility, and unpredictability. By decentralizing command and adopting hit-and-run tactics, our forces can bleed a stronger enemy dry, disrupting supply lines and undermining morale. Victory is not measured in territory gained, but in the cost imposed on the occupier."
